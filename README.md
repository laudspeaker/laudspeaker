</a>

### Setting up with docker:

Run services:

- `docker-compose up` or `docker compose up` depending on your version of docker

Instantiate Mongo:

- `mongosh --eval "rs.initiate()"`

Run backend and front end:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

To stop running system services (Linux):

- Postgres: `sudo systemctl stop postgresql.service`
- Redis: `/etc/init.d/redis-server stop`
- Mongo: `sudo systemctl stop mongod`

To remove compose containers:

- `docker-compose down --volumes`

Add a `.env` file to both `packages/server` and `packages/client`.

We have provided examples which you can use:

`cp env-server-example packages/server/.env` and `cp env-client-example packages/client/.env`

Make sure you fill in the fields in the env files before running.

## 🔥 What makes Laudspeaker cool?

Lauspeaker is the only multi-channel open-source customer messaging workflow software, which is focused on being event triggered, has been built with a visual journey feature from day one and is focused on scalability.

We support email, sms and slack as a channel and have many more channels on our roadmap.

We are planning to build Laudspeaker to work well with the Modern Data Stack, integrating with data warehouses and other services so you can easily import and export data with no fear of lock in or losing control of your data.

## 🐥 Status

- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [laudspeaker.com](https://laudspeaker.com) but go easy on us, there are wrinkles and we're just getting started.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready.

We're currently in Public Alpha.
